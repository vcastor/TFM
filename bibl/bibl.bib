shift of the lowest-lying bright electronic excitation of the

protein (PYP) is shown to stem from a subtle balance between
hypsochromic and bathochromic effects. More specifically, it is found
that the change in the excitation energy as a consequence of the
disruption of the planarity of pCA(-) inside PYP is nearly canceled
out by the shift induced by the intermolecular interactions of the
chromophore and the protein as a whole. These results provide
important insights about the primary absorption and the tuning of the
chromophore by the protein environment in PYP.},

abstract = {The unique chemical and physical properties of liquid
water are a direct result of its highly directional hydrogen-bond (HB)
network structure and associated dynamics. However, despite intense
experimental and theoretical scrutiny spanning more than four decades,
a coherent description of this HB network remains elusive. The
essential question of whether continuum or multicomponent ("intact,"
"broken bond," etc.) models best describe the HB interactions in
liquid water has engendered particularly intense discussion. Most
notably, the temperature dependence of water's Raman spectrum has long
been considered to be among the strongest evidence for a
multicomponent distribution. Using a combined experimental and
theoretical approach, we show here that many of the features of the
Raman spectrum that are considered to be hallmarks of a multistate
system, including the asymmetric band profile, the isosbestic
(temperature invariant) point, and van't Hoff behavior, actually
result from a continuous distribution. Furthermore, the excellent
agreement between our newly remeasured Raman spectra and our model
system further supports the locally tetrahedral description of liquid
water, which has recently been called into question.},

@article{ippolito2001,
abstract = {Water treatment residuals (WTRs) are a by-product of
municipal drinking water treatment plants and can have the capacity to
adsorb tremendous amounts of P. Understanding the WTR phosphorus
adsorption process is important for discerning the mechanism and
tenacity of P retention. We studied P adsorbing mechanism(s) of an
aluminum-based [Al2(SO4)3 x 14H2O] WTR from Englewood, CO. In a
laboratory study, we shook mixtures of P-loaded WTR for 1 to 211 d
followed by solution pH analysis, and solution Ca, Al, and P analysis
via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. After
shaking periods, we also examined the solids fraction by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and electron microprobe analysis using wavelength
dispersive spectroscopy (EMPA-WDS). The shaking results indicated an
increase in pH from 7.2 to 8.2, an increase in desorbed Ca and Al
concentrations, and a decrease in desorbed P concentration. The pH and
desorbed Ca concentration increases suggested that CaCO3 controlled Ca
solubility. Increased desorbed Al concentration may have been due to
Al(OH)4 formation. Decreased P content, in conjunction with the pH
increase, was consistent with calcium phosphate formation or
precipitation. The system appeared to be undersaturated with respect
to dicalcium phosphate (DCP; CaHPO4) and supersaturated with respect
to octacalcium phosphate [OCP; Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5H2O]. The Ca and Al
increases, as well as OCP formation, were supported by MINTEQA2
modeling. The XRD and EMPA-WDS results for all shaking times, however,
suggested surface P chemisorption as an amorphous Al-P mineral
phase.},

the rate of increase in global surface temperature over 2000-2009 by
about 25\% compared to that which would have occurred due only to
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. More limited data suggest
that stratospheric water vapor probably increased between 1980 and
2000, which would have enhanced the decadal rate of surface warming
during the 1990s by about 30\% as compared to estimates neglecting
this change. These findings show that stratospheric water vapor is an
important driver of decadal global surface climate change.},

(H(2)O)(2) and (HF)(2). For (NH(3))(2), we study three characteristic

the basis set convergence when diffuse functions on the hydrogen atoms

correlation with valence-only correlation-consistent basis sets.
Overall, the counterpoise-corrected and extrapolated geometries appear
to be very reliable and are in convincing agreement with the
geometries from explicitly correlated MP2-F12 calculations. Obtaining
geometries with errors of less than 0.001 \AA ngstrom and 0.5 degrees
compared to the basis set limit is, however, even with these advanced
methods a difficult task.},

This paper determines the formulae of density and relative density, with their uncertainties, in the temperature range 0 °C to 40 °C. The uncertainty estimation of one of the reports included in the analysis has been re-evaluated. Effects on water density due to isotopic mixtures other than SMOW, ambient pressures different from 101 325 Pa, and the presence of dissolved air, are also reviewed.}
