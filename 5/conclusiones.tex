\chapter{Conclusions}

We have used the IQA partition applied to the ELF topology to study the
connectivity of small water cluster.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The use of M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ was a good way to predict the electronic
energy and the wavefunction to compute a topology ELF analysis.

\item We have the best set up known to compute small water cluster ELF analysis
with {\sc{Promelf}} code.

\item The results are in general consistent with topological studies on the
electronic density in similar systems, as we compared with the result published
~\cite{tomas, Toche2016, Castor2020}.

\item The code written to compute the systems would be useful for future
researchers having just one input file to do a NCI plot or TopMod work. As well
to have a new \texttt{*.wfn} file with the ELF maxima.

\item As for now, the integration seem to be complicated, difficulting the
analysis of general trends from IQA-ELF partition in water clusters.

\end{enumerate}
